### Problem Statement:
Living with roommates often comes with challenges like splitting chores, managing shared expenses, coordinating grocery shopping, and maintaining harmony in shared spaces. Without an organized system, these tasks can lead to misunderstandings, inefficiency, and frustration. A comprehensive solution is needed to streamline these aspects of shared living while promoting accountability and cooperation.
